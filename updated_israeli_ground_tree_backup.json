The French already have this tank in the game,&nbsp;but Israel also used it. In fact, it was one of the first tanks Israel ever used. Acquired in 1948 from the stock of WWII&nbsp;vehicles withdraw from services, Israel bought 8 H 39 tanks for use in their own armoured forces, 3&nbsp;of the base model and 5&nbsp;that were the modified German variant with a new cupola. While not a large number of tanks, it was enough to start their army. They&nbsp;served with the 8th Armoured Brigade which, along with many other bridades,&nbsp;formed the Haganah militia and was the first proper Israeli tanks.

So,&nbsp;Israel had to make do with what they had. The M14 with serial number 3259 was converted to a prototype SPAAG in an attempt to develop an efficient and mobile anti-air vehicle. While the M14 was indeed originally a decent SPAA, and would still have&nbsp;been useful in 1948, Israel had received M14s that had been converted to APCs by the British. The prototype made from the vehicle with the serial number 3259 has twin Hotchkiss 13.2 mm Mle. 1929 guns fitted to it. The conversion was made by the 32th Battalion of the 8th Armoured Brigade in 1948. It saw service&nbsp;and possibly combat, but only one was ever built.

Israel had received a large number of various half-tracks, but most of them was unarmed, so they were converted to APCs. During the Arab-Israeli War of 1948, Israeli armored forces were fielding half-tracks in roles they were not intended to serve&nbsp;in. Trying to find a more specialized use for&nbsp;their&nbsp;half-track to make them more suitable as combat vehicles, Israel&nbsp;created a lot of modifications of&nbsp;their half-tracks. Most of those modifications consisted of adding armament to the half-tracks, many with turrets.</p>\n\n<p>This particular version is rather interesting. similar to the Zachlam&nbsp;Scotti-IF, this version was a sister development which&nbsp;was armed with the 20 mm Hispano-Suiza HS.804. The HS.804 had&nbsp;much better firepower than the Scotti-IF 20/70. This vehicles was modified by the 32th Battalion of the 8th Armoured Brigade in 1948. The purpose of this vehicle&nbsp;was not&nbsp;to be SPAA, but rather a light tank/armoured reconnaissance vehicle and&nbsp;was a direct answer of&nbsp;PALMACH who issued an&nbsp;order for&nbsp;at least 1 half-track equipped with 20 mm autocannon in every mechanized unit, as this armament was&nbsp;effective against armoured targets. This requirement led to many&nbsp;half-track modifications,&nbsp;some of which were almost standardized. This vehicle served a duel role as a light tank and an SPAAG, and received a sort of acceptation for services as a semi-standard. At least 1 was built, but it is possible there was up to 7 were constructed. It/they&nbsp;served with the&nbsp;IDF during the Arab-Israeli War of 1948.

Known documents state that four were built, but there are only images showing up to three. This conversion of the M5 was not standardized due to Israel obtaining the M4 Sherman at the end of 1948.

After deciding that it worked well, France taught Israel how to perform the upgrade locally and sold the ammunition for the gun.</p>\n\n<p>But then, France came up with another idea. Knowing that Israel tried to aquire a 17-pounder gun for the Sherman, France proposed using their SA50 L/57&nbsp;cannon. The contract was much better for France too as there were only 27 M10s to upgrade, but there were 300 Shermans. Israel had adopted the idea of the Sherman being&nbsp;upgunned and concluded that the M10 with SA50 was not needed.&nbsp;Thus,&nbsp;the Israeli M10 was used for secondary role and armed with the 17-pounder that was already acquired from UK. The tests with the SA50 gun on the M10 platform ended in 1954.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Primary weapon:&nbsp;<strong>75 mm SA50 L/57 cannon</strong></h3>\n\n<p>A very good gun capable of penetrating 190 mm of armour, but it could only fire solid shot projectiles.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Mobility:&nbsp;<strong>42 km/h</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Average for a tank of its tier.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Armour:&nbsp;<strong>55 mm</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Decent, but the sides are incredibly weak.</p>\n","id":"v1672125793207","thumbnail":"https://i.imgur.com/h1vcBgu.png","images":[{"image":"https://i0.wp.com/ritastatusreport.live/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/elticpk.jpg","description":""},{"image":"https://i0.wp.com/ritastatusreport.live/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/l51pmfo.jpg?resize=660%2C470&ssl=1","description":""}]},{"name":"Sherman Krupp","rank":2,"br":2.7,"type":"premium","connection":"no","branch":1,"classIcon":"mt","description":"<h3>Year:&nbsp;<strong>1949</strong></h3>\n\n<h3>Development stage:&nbsp;<strong>Local modification</strong></h3>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Description &amp; History</h3>\n\n<p>Israel imported some M4 Shermans from Italy.

History</h3>\n\n<p>The Sholef, developed as a joint venture by IMI (Israeli Military Industries)&nbsp;and Soltam Systems, is an experimental self-propelled howitzer based on the hull of the Merkava Mk. 1B. 2 prototypes were built, both of which were fully tested by the IDF, though the vehicle eventually lost to the American M109A5 due to&nbsp;it, despite being a better platform, also being prohibitively expensive at almost double the price of the M109A5 per unit. While the vehicle was based on the Merkava Mk. 1 hull, it used the 1200 hp engine of the Merkava Mk. 3 which significantly boosted its mobility and gave it a power-to-weight&nbsp;ratio of 26.67 hp/t which is higher than that of the M1A1 and M1A2. Two prototypes of the vehicle were built: the Sholef V1 and Sholef V2. The V1 had a 155 mm L/45&nbsp;cannon, and the V2 had a 155 mm L/52&nbsp;cannon, both capable of firing all NATO standard ammunition, though it never ended up firing any form of armour-piercing round. Both prototypes still survive, with one being on display at the Beit Hatotchan Artillery Museum in&nbsp;Zichron-Ya&#39;akov, Israel, and the other sitting in Soltam Systems R&amp;D and available for public viewing, though the V1 prototype was fitted with the L/52 cannon of the V2 for displahy purposes. However, in older images, the shorter gun of the V1 can be seen.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Primary weapon:&nbsp;<strong>155 mm L/52 cannon (Ammo: 75)</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The 155 mm cannon is the standard gun for NATO artillery pieces and the specific gun used on the Sholef was capable of firing all NATO standard rounds. It featured an autoloader that gave it a 6.67 second reload with the autoloader containing 60 rounds, with the remaining 15 being stored in the hull. The vehicle actually fired the M107A3 HE round which is an extended range version of the American M107 round, the M481&nbsp;HE-ER-BT (High Explosive Extended Range Boat Tail) which had 10.5 kg of TNT and featured&nbsp;a more aerodynamic shape allowing it to maintain the same accuracy as the M107A3 while bosting a significantly higher muzzle velocity of 945 m/s, the M401&nbsp;HE-ER-BB (High Explosive Extended Range Base Bleed) proximity fuze round with 12 kg of TNT which would be the best round available to the vehicle, and the M150 smoke shell with a muzzle velocity of 890 m/s and a smoke duration of 3 minutes. The down side of the gun is that while it does have 70 degrees of gun elevation, its depression is only -5 degrees. However, the gun handling&nbsp;will be excellent as the vehicle has a full 360 degrees of traverse and a two-plane stabilizer, even if it does lack a laser rangefinder.&nbsp;The vehicle also featured a 12.7 mm M2HB heavy machine gun with 1000 rounds as secondary armament.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Mobility:&nbsp;<strong>60</strong><strong>&nbsp;km/h</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The speed is good enough, even if it is not very impressive. However, what is impressive is the 26.67 hp/t power-to-weight ratio which is greater than the power-to-weight ratio of both the M1A1 and M1A2 and gives vehicle amazing acceleration and allows it to reach its top speed very quickly.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Armour:&nbsp;<strong>90 mm</strong></h3>\n\n<p>90 mm of composite armour is good, but it&#39;s only on the hull. The frontally-mounted engine does provide extra protection, but that doesn&#39;t matter very much as the turret is where most of the crewmembers are and has incredibly low armour levels. The frontally-mounted engine also makes it very easy for enemies to stop the tank from moving which would make cresting ridgelines difficult.</p>\n","id":"v1672192749543","thumbnail":"https://github.com/gszabi99/War-Thunder-Datamine/blob/68d2bf8595aae5d9cbefa272bfc13c9a0f8b9eeb/atlases.vromfs.bin_u/units/image_in_progress.png?raw=true","images":[{"image":"http://www.military-today.com/artillery/sholef_l1.jpg","description":""},{"image":"https://i-com.cdn.gaijin.net/monthly_2022_06/sholef-image08.jpg.550ee2d19f1f64319c91201df960492b.jpg","description":"Sholef V2 on the left"},{"image":"https://www.himush.co.il/media/2021/10/image(59).png","description":"Sholef V2 on the right"},{"image":"https://www.himush.co.il/media/2021/10/image(73).png","description":""}]},{"name":"Zil-157 (MAR-240)","rank":3,"br":4.3,"type":"premium","connection":"no","branch":2,"classIcon":"td","description":"","id":"v1672207887309","thumbnail":"https://github.com/gszabi99/War-Thunder-Datamine/blob/68d2bf8595aae5d9cbefa272bfc13c9a0f8b9eeb/atlases.vromfs.bin_u/units/image_in_progress.png?raw=true","images":[{"image":"https://i.imgur.com/uRGsrnY.jpg","description":""}]},{"name":"Episkopi","rank":4,"br":6.7,"type":"premium","connection":"no","branch":1,"classIcon":"td","description":"","id":"v1672208189801","thumbnail":"https://github.com/gszabi99/War-Thunder-Datamine/blob/68d2bf8595aae5d9cbefa272bfc13c9a0f8b9eeb/atlases.vromfs.bin_u/units/image_in_progress.png?raw=true","images":[{"image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/MAR-290-batey-haosef-1.jpg","description":"","thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/MAR-290-batey-haosef-1.jpg","big":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/MAR-290-batey-haosef-1.jpg"},{"image":"https://en.missilery.info/files/m/mar_290/sherman.jpg","description":"","thumb":"https://en.missilery.info/files/m/mar_290/sherman.jpg","big":"https://en.missilery.info/files/m/mar_290/sherman.jpg"},{"image":"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4chLk1uxmhE/WjTHdWMtWHI/AAAAAAAAjnQ/5M9GJW1K1JUYAPQNXz_XvxZjjBO07rCFACLcBGAs/s1600/Episkopi.png","description":"","thumb":"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4chLk1uxmhE/WjTHdWMtWHI/AAAAAAAAjnQ/5M9GJW1K1JUYAPQNXz_XvxZjjBO07rCFACLcBGAs/s1600/Episkopi.png","big":"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4chLk1uxmhE/WjTHdWMtWHI/AAAAAAAAjnQ/5M9GJW1K1JUYAPQNXz_XvxZjjBO07rCFACLcBGAs/s1600/Episkopi.png"},{"image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/MAR-290-2.jpg","description":"","thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/MAR-290-2.jpg","big":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/MAR-290-2.jpg"},{"image":"https://weaponsparade.com/wp-content/uploads/mlrs-isr-M.4-MAR.240240mm-1-1024x911.jpg","description":"","thumb":"https://weaponsparade.com/wp-content/uploads/mlrs-isr-M.4-MAR.240240mm-1-1024x911.jpg","big":"https://weaponsparade.com/wp-content/uploads/mlrs-isr-M.4-MAR.240240mm-1-1024x911.jpg"},{"image":"https://weaponsparade.com/wp-content/uploads/mlrs-isr-M.4-MAR.240240mm-2.jpg","description":"","thumb":"https://weaponsparade.com/wp-content/uploads/mlrs-isr-M.4-MAR.240240mm-2.jpg","big":"https://weaponsparade.com/wp-content/uploads/mlrs-isr-M.4-MAR.240240mm-2.jpg"},{"image":"http://topwar.ru/uploads/posts/2012-11/1352236644_1.jpg","description":"","thumb":"http://topwar.ru/uploads/posts/2012-11/1352236644_1.jpg","big":"http://topwar.ru/uploads/posts/2012-11/1352236644_1.jpg"}]},{"name":"Eshel ha-Yarden","rank":4,"br":7,"type":"premium","connection":"no","branch":2,"classIcon":"td","description":"<h3>Year:&nbsp;<strong>1980</strong></h3>\n\n<h3>Development stage:&nbsp;<strong>Prototype</strong></h3>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Description &amp; History</h3>\n\n<p>The RSZO MAR-290, also known as the Eshel ha-Yarden, was a prototype for a second generation MAR-240 MLRS that was fitted to the hull of a Centurion instead of the hull of an M-51.

Initially, Israel planned to purchase modified Chieftain tanks and 2 Chieftain Mk. 3s were modified to the Israeli Chieftain Mk. 4 standard and sent to Israel for testing. One was later scrapped and the other was modified and sent to a training ground in Scotland. Famously, during the Yom Kippur War,&nbsp;Britain asked Israel to move their two Chieftain tanks closer to the heart of the nation because they were&nbsp;close to the border and Britain didn&#39;t want it to get out that there were Chieftains in Israel.

V1","rank":5,"br":8.3,"type":"premium","connection":"no","branch":2,"classIcon":"td","description":"<h3>Year:&nbsp;<strong>1984</strong></h3>\n\n<h3>Development stage:&nbsp;<strong>Prototype</strong></h3>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Description &amp; History</h3>\n\n<p>The Sholef, developed as a joint venture by IMI (Israeli Military Industries)&nbsp;and Soltam Systems, is an experimental self-propelled howitzer based on the hull of the Merkava Mk. 1B. 2 prototypes were built, both of which were fully tested by the IDF, though the vehicle eventually lost to the American M109A5 due to&nbsp;it, despite being a better platform, also being prohibitively expensive at almost double the price of the M109A5 per unit. While the vehicle was based on the Merkava Mk. 1 hull, it used the 1200 hp engine of the Merkava Mk. 3 which significantly boosted its mobility and gave it a power-to-weight&nbsp;ratio of 26.67 hp/t which is higher than that of the M1A1 and M1A2. Two prototypes of the vehicle were built: the Sholef V1 and Sholef V2. The V1 had a 155 mm L/45 cannon, and the V2 had a 155 mm L/52 cannon, both capable of firing all NATO standard ammunition, though it never ended up firing any form of armour-piercing round. Both prototypes still survive, with one being on display at the Beit Hatotchan Artillery Museum in&nbsp;Zichron-Ya&#39;akov, Israel, and the other sitting in Soltam Systems R&amp;D and available for public viewing, though the V1 prototype was fitted with the L/52 cannon of the V2 for displahy purposes. However, in older images, the shorter gun of the V1 can be&nbsp;seen.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Primary weapon:&nbsp;<strong>155 mm L/45&nbsp;cannon (Ammo: 75)</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The 155 mm cannon is the standard gun for NATO artillery pieces and the specific gun used on the Sholef was capable of firing all NATO standard rounds. It featured an autoloader that gave it a 6.67 second reload with the autoloader containing 60 rounds, with the remaining 15 being stored in the hull. The vehicle actually fired the M107A3 HE round which is an extended range version of the American M107 round, the M481&nbsp;HE-ER-BT (High Explosive Extended Range Boat Tail) which had 10.5 kg of TNT and featured&nbsp;a more aerodynamic shape allowing it to maintain the same accuracy as the M107A3 while bosting a significantly higher muzzle velocity of 945 m/s, the M401&nbsp;HE-ER-BB (High Explosive Extended Range Base Bleed) proximity fuze round with 12 kg of TNT which would be the best round available to the vehicle, and the M150 smoke shell with a muzzle velocity of 890 m/s and a smoke duration of 3 minutes. The down side of the gun is that while it does have 70 degrees of gun elevation, its depression is only -5 degrees. However, the gun handling&nbsp;will be excellent as the vehicle has a full 360 degrees of traverse and a two-plane stabilizer, even if it does lack a laser rangefinder.&nbsp;The vehicle also featured a 12.7 mm M2HB heavy machine gun with 1000 rounds as secondary armament.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Mobility:&nbsp;<strong>60</strong><strong>&nbsp;km/h</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The speed is good enough, even if it is not very impressive. However, what is impressive is the 26.67 hp/t power-to-weight ratio which is greater than the power-to-weight ratio of both the M1A1 and M1A2 and gives vehicle amazing acceleration and allows it to reach its top speed very quickly.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Armour:&nbsp;<strong>90 mm</strong></h3>\n\n<p>90 mm of composite armour is good, but it&#39;s only on the hull. The frontally-mounted engine does provide extra protection, but that doesn&#39;t matter very much as the turret is where most of the crewmembers are and has incredibly low armour levels. The frontally-mounted engine also makes it very easy for enemies to stop the tank from moving which would make cresting ridgelines

The vehicle is a Mercedes-Benz NG 4850AS 8x8 truck with a Mk.15 Phalanx CIWS Block 1B PSuM system and 12 Israeli BARAK-1 surface-to-air missiles.

Other than that, it is incredibly similar to the L76 M61A1 already ingame. The BARAK-1 is an Israeli-designed SAM that would function differently from every other SAM in the game. It&#39;s radar-guided, but is quite slow, with a speed of only 720 m/s, but a range of 12 km. However, if the target is far enough, the missile, instead of going in a straight line for the target, will climb to an altitude of up to&nbsp;5.5 km and then head for the target. This is called lofting and the lofting altitude is adjusted based on the distance to the target.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Mobility:&nbsp;<strong>90</strong><strong>&nbsp;km/h</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The mobility is excellent due to the vehicle being wheeled and rather light, and that is made even better by a power-to-weight ratio&nbsp;24.75 hp/t with a 500 hp engine.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Armour:&nbsp;<strong>Unknown</strong></h3>\n\n<p>It is unknown the exact armour, but regardless, it would have been practically nonexistent and everything ingame could machine gun the vehicle to death.</p>\n","id":"v1672274107913","thumbnail":"https://github.com/gszabi99/War-Thunder-Datamine/blob/68d2bf8595aae5d9cbefa272bfc13c9a0f8b9eeb/atlases.vromfs.bin_u/units/image_in_progress.png?raw=true","images":[]},{"name":"Pereh","rank":7,"br":10.7,"type":"researchable","connection":"yes","branch":3,"classIcon":"td","follow":"v1672277527746","description":"<h3>Year:&nbsp;<strong>1980s</strong></h3>\n\n<h3>Development stage:&nbsp;<strong>Domestic design</strong></h3>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Description &amp; History</h3>\n\n<p>The Pereh is a anti-tank guided missile carrier disguised as an MBT.

In 2017, the Pereh was retired from service due the use of a fake gun as camouflage being revealed which rendered it pointless and because the Spike missile array was&nbsp;transfared to the IAF&#39;s responsibilty with Helicopters being the launch platforms.&nbsp;It is unknown as to whether the IDF wants to replace it with another tank destroyer or anti-tank guided missile carrier, plans to just use the Merkava and its gun-launched LAHAT ATGM in its stead, or intends to upgrade it and put a new variant of it into service.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Primary weapon:&nbsp;<strong>Spike NLOS ATGM x12</strong></h3>\n\n<p>A hyper-effective anti-tank missile that can hit targets up to 25 kilometres away.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Mobility:&nbsp;<strong>Unknown</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The mobility is unknown, but it can be assumed that it is at least decent as it has to navigate a lot of harsh terrain in the environments it finds itself fighting in.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Armour:&nbsp;<strong>Unknown</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The effectiveness of the armour is entirely unknown.</p>\n","id":"v1672275998478","thumbnail":"https://github.com/gszabi99/War-Thunder-Datamine/blob/68d2bf8595aae5d9cbefa272bfc13c9a0f8b9eeb/atlases.vromfs.bin_u/units/image_in_progress.png?raw=true","images":[{"image":"https://i.redd.it/hazxla8oafo41.jpg","description":""},{"image":"https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-64a8b80404bd20b2f632cb3cbf0a34be-c","description":""},{"image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%90.jpg","description":""},{"image":"http://www.military-today.com/missiles/pere.jpg","description":""},{"image":"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FOCL24wXEAMieQf.jpg","description":""},{"image":"https://tankandafvnews.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/43131209.jpg","description":""},{"image":"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-97e5f6ca5b9a102a906799f0fe7e7d52.webp","description":""}]},{"name":"Namer (RCWS-30)","rank":7,"br":11.3,"type":"researchable","connection":"yes","branch":3,"classIcon":"lt","description":"","id":"v1672276649925","thumbnail":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1017873001888358401/1017892921187520612/il_achzarit_rcws30.png","images":[{"image":"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZXGclmHu_-o/WIjGBUwim8I/AAAAAAAAAS0/my7hwYZBlHE0gz4PcX4cTwEbP95keugkQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/321.jpg","description":"","thumb":"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZXGclmHu_-o/WIjGBUwim8I/AAAAAAAAAS0/my7hwYZBlHE0gz4PcX4cTwEbP95keugkQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/321.jpg","big":"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZXGclmHu_-o/WIjGBUwim8I/AAAAAAAAAS0/my7hwYZBlHE0gz4PcX4cTwEbP95keugkQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/321.jpg"},{"image":"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zRWwt-l5l7A/WIjGBWSdkXI/AAAAAAAAASs/BKi05AJBqKI5zBAM8BvvHwjd8376mdzcACLcB/s1600/123.jpg","description":"","thumb":"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zRWwt-l5l7A/WIjGBWSdkXI/AAAAAAAAASs/BKi05AJBqKI5zBAM8BvvHwjd8376mdzcACLcB/s1600/123.jpg","big":"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zRWwt-l5l7A/WIjGBWSdkXI/AAAAAAAAASs/BKi05AJBqKI5zBAM8BvvHwjd8376mdzcACLcB/s1600/123.jpg"},{"image":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1004925662395633664/1057383890626560010/72516060.png","description":"","thumb":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1004925662395633664/1057383890626560010/72516060.png","big":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1004925662395633664/1057383890626560010/72516060.png"}]},{"name":"Namer (UT30)","rank":7,"br":11,"type":"event_alt_bg","connection":"no","branch":2,"classIcon":"lt","description":"","id":"v1672276699831","thumbnail":"https://github.com/gszabi99/War-Thunder-Datamine/blob/68d2bf8595aae5d9cbefa272bfc13c9a0f8b9eeb/atlases.vromfs.bin_u/units/image_in_progress.png?raw=true","images":[{"image":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1004925662395633664/1057383792605667398/55055157.png","description":""}]},{"name":"Namer IFV","rank":7,"br":11.7,"type":"researchable","connection":"yes","branch":3,"classIcon":"lt","follow":"v1672277170804","description":"<h3>Year:&nbsp;<strong>2017</strong></h3>\n\n<h3>Development stage:&nbsp;<strong>Domestic design</strong></h3>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Description &amp; History</h3>\n\n<p>The Namer CEV was put into development after the Israel-Gaza conflict in 2004. The first prototype was built in 2005, and additional combat knowledge gained from the 2006 Lebanon War was used in the development of further prototypes.&nbsp;It was unveiled to the public in 2008&nbsp;and was touted as a next-generation APC and CEV. In the same year, 100 Namers were delivered to the Israeli Army. The vehicle was based on the chassis of what was, at the time, the brand new Merkava Mk. 4. In 2016, the Namer was equipped with the Israeli-designed and built Trophy APS&nbsp;&mdash; the same APS used on the Merkava Mk. 4M. In 2017, an IFV version of the Namer was unveiled to the public and is currently in testing.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Primary weapon:&nbsp;<strong>Mk44S 30 mm cannon (Ammo: 200), Spike-MR ATGM x2</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The Namer carries the Mk44S 30 mm cannon&nbsp;&mdash; a deadly cannon useful in both the anti-infantry and anti-tank role, being especially effective against lightly armoured or unarmoured targets.

service&nbsp;with the 75 mm M3 gun. Being put into service&nbsp;in&nbsp;1948 by&nbsp;the Israeli militia, some of them, 13 to be exact, saw action during the late stages of the Arab-Israeli War of 1948. Israel bought 35 Shermans in 1948, but only 14 were ready for combat while the remaining 21 required maintenance. They served originally with&nbsp;the 8th Armoured Brigade and was by far&nbsp;the best tank in service in the region. Fighting mainly obsolete light tanks, the M-3 gave Israel a massive combat advantage.</p>\n\n<p>Following 1948, Israel bough a lot more Shermans at cheap prices from European scrapyards. Those went to strengthen the Israeli armoured forces and became the standard Israeli tank. In 1956, Israel began a deep upgrade program for their Sherman fleet which involved installing the 75 mm SA50 L/57 gun. During this program, they recieved their designations with the M4A4s with the 75 mm M3 gun recieving the designation of M-3.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Primary weapon:&nbsp;<strong>75 mm

Israel had acquired the Sherman in 1948 in rather small quantities. Despite it being great compared to what they were facing at the time, they know the 75mm gun and even the 76mm gun were obsolete. Israel needed something more modern with more punch. Just starting to have full access to imported tanks, Israel aquired&nbsp;a large number of Shermans from European junkyards. At first, they were only allowed to by 75mm Shermans, usually with the gun disabled. However, over time, Europe began to sell them Shermans of all kinds that were considered obsolete as they were being replaced with M26s and M47s. While it was obsolete, they used the 76mm M1 cannon as a stopgap while they tried to get something better (which turned out to be the SA50 cannon)&nbsp;and these vehicles were named the M-1.</p>\n\n<p>From 1956 onwards, all shermans in Israel were named after their gun.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Primary weapon:&nbsp;<strong>76mm M1 cannon</strong></h3>\n\n<p>A good gun for its tier that&#39;s been proven effective as this vehicle is already in the American tree.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Mobility:&nbsp;<strong>39 km/h</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Average for its tier.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Armour:&nbsp;<strong>50mm</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Not reliable at this tier, just like the armour on the other M-50s&nbsp;and the M4A4 (SA-50).
